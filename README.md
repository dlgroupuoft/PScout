This repository hosts the original version of the PScout Android permission mapping tool.  A description of the tool and an evaluation can be found in the published [paper](http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~lie/papers/PScout-CCS2012-web.pdf "paper").  Datasets produced by this tool and additional information are available on the [tool website](http://pscout.csl.toronto.edu "tool website")

Instructions for building and using the tool can be found in the accompanying BUILDING file.  Note that the main author for PScout has moved on and we do not have the resources to maintain PScout or address issues.  However, the repository is monitored and contributions are welcome.
